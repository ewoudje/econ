#### - Ewoud's Platform Independent Console Framework

This directory specifies headers and the source for the system
for my console.

Each game includes the Inc folder for their game and uses system calls etc to run the game and show it.

Why do i make platform independent system etc? 
Because if i ever want to use or work further on this for a further project 
i might want to run this on another microcontroller etc.

And it is always nice to have clean abstractions!
